//! `crucible-broker`: the domain-agnostic mediated-provisioning broker.
//!
//! The sandboxed agent has NO direct authority to spend GPU, submit a Kueue Workload, or
//! dispatch CI. Instead it asks this server-side broker (the loop-pod MCP) for a resource,
//! today `request_trace`: "give me a calibrated trace for these run params." The broker holds
//! the privilege and the admission logic and decides:
//!
//! ```text
//!   cache HIT             -> return the cached knobs, the turn continues GPU-free
//!   MISS + in-scope       -> admission-gate a capture (no judge change)
//!   MISS + judge-changing -> needs human approval (re-scope), or escalate-halt if headless
//! ```
//!
//! This crate is the reusable engine: the typed request/resolution surface ([`types`]), the
//! content key + judge-impact classifier ([`types::trace_id`] / [`types::judge_impact`]), the
//! [`TraceResolver`]/[`Admission`]/[`ApprovalBackend`] boundaries, the MCP wire ([`server`]), and
//! the engine-side build/measure/profile tools (forge-backed). It holds NO domain logic: the
//! concrete trace-cache resolver is injected by the per-domain broker binary. crucible spawns
//! that binary; it never links it.
